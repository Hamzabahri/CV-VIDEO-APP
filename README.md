# CV-VIDEO-APP

Successively, we went from the invention of writing to the creation of printing,
disseminating information from a paper medium to an internet medium where the creation of information<br>
no longer belongs to a certain category of authors but where each individual can become
nir creator and reader of information.<br>
Digital uses have changed the way of applying for a job offer. indeed, beautiful
Recruiters still print CVs today, but only those that interest them.<br>
The video CV is a great decision-making tool for recruiters, because whoever is going to
give an overview of candidate, when cannot have on printed sheets. otherwise,
candidates will show their skills and experiences in pictures to disembark from others.<br>
